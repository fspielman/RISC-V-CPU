# RISC-V RV32I CPU

Two implementations of a RISC-V RV32I processor written in VHDL.  
Developed independently to deepen my understanding of VHDL and CPU architecture.  
Implemented in Quartus Prime; Verified in ModelSim.

## Overview 
- **[`Single-Cycle CPU`](single_cycle/)** – a baseline RV32I implementation 
- **[`Pipelined CPU`](pipelined/)** – extends the single-cycle design with a 5-stage pipeline and hazard control
