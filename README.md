# RISC-V RV32I CPU

Two implementations of a RISC-V RV32I processor written in VHDL.  
Developed independently to deepen my understanding of VHDL and CPU architecture.  

## Overview 
- **Single-Cycle CPU** – a baseline RV32I implementation
- **Pipelined CPU** – extends the single-cycle design with a 5-stage pipeline and hazard control
